## My process
Here are the tools and technologies I employed to address this challenge, insights gained throughout the problem-solving journey, areas in which I aspire to enhance my skills in the coming days, and articles that proved beneficial for me, potentially aiding others in overcoming similar challenges on Frontend Mentor or elsewhere.

This is the approach I took to address this challenge. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Once again, the 'max-width' CSS property is very useful in responsive design. This is my best solution yet as it is Responsive NO matter what device the user is using.

Here is a CSS rule I used to make sure the content doesn't look too goofy:

```css
.text div{
    padding: 3rem;
    max-width: 634.5px;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm finally getting a firm grip on responsive design (With CSS FLexbox and Media queries)...I'll get there soon...


### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is was a clear and concise documentation that helped me lots during this challenge. I believe every web developer is familiar with it but I still need to mention it in case.
